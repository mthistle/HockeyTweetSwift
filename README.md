HockeyTweetSwift
================

Port of 2009 iOS Twitter App to 2014 Swift based app.

I wanted to learn Swift and what better way to learn it than by porting my first iOS app over to Swift. So that is what this is, the end result of the port.

What works?
* UI ported
* UI optimized for iPhone 4 (like original)
* UI works with a lot of open space for iPhone 5+ and iPad
* Model ported
* Application was refactored from the Uber-Kitchen-Sink-ViewController to a simpler view controller with a class per UIPicker. Much nicer than the original.
* Loading of cached content data.

What does not work yet?
* Networking not implemented yet.
